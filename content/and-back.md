summary:It's been more than a year since I've blogged (which might or might not be a reflection of my IRL productivity over that same time frame), and the slowly rising level of shame proved to be just enough to counter the unstoppable juggernaut that is my laziness. I now know how much my laziness is worth - about 16 months of languishing.


It's been more than a year since I've blogged (which might or might
not be a reflection of my IRL productivity over that same time frame),
and the slowly rising level of shame proved to be just enough to
counter the unstoppable juggernaut that is my laziness. I now know how
much my laziness is worth - about 16 months of languishing.

Of course, it would offend my deeply rooted laziness if I refused to
prevaricate in the 'passive-aggresive-productive-but-not-really' way I
do best and spend hours researching worthy blog framework contenders
first. So that's just what I did. It wasn't all fruitless though, oh
no.

You see, I like Ruby, but I absolutely adore Python. The
[last time](my-blog-setup.html) I was on the hunt for a suitable
framework, Jekyll and Octopress seemed a lot better conceived than
their Python counterparts (because who am I to sit and muck about with
themes and the like...html/css is too much effort). However, this time
around I was *very* pleasantly surprised at the maturity of both
[Nikola](http://getnikola.com/) and
[Pelican](http://blog.getpelican.com/).

To my inexperienced eyes, they were both close enough in terms of
simplicity, features, community, and documentation that I ended up
making a decision based on...well nothing really, call it a coin-flip
that went in Pelican's favor. So far, it's been rather trivial to get
Pelican up and working, and cook up a quick script to migrate my posts
(**all** 3 of them) over. I'm using the very awesome
[pelican-cait](https://github.com/hdra/pelican-cait) theme, which I've
minimally modified for my needs.

Unlike last time, I also have a vague, amorphous plan in terms of
subsequent posts, so this shouldn't turn into a graveyard like my
previous attempt. Only time will tell though...
