                    <section class="post-content">
                        <p>I've been meaning to blog for some time now, having a vague sense that
it would be beneficial but never really sitting down to examine it
more closely. I did just that today though, and realized that there
are so many good reasons for me to maintain one there was no point in
delaying it any longer. It seemed natural to begin by listing the top
3 things I'm expecting blogging will help me with.</p>
<h4>1. Complete what I begin</h4>
<p>Often, when I'm working on a new project, I'm sorely tempted to go
online in an attempt to better educate myself about what's already
been done. A few hours and many links later, I've found something else
that interests me so much that I drop what I was working on to attempt
that instead.</p>
<p>In some ways its a consequence of an entirely good thing---a sense of
fascination for the things I encounter. What I really need is
something to force my attention back to what I've started so I can see
them through to completion. Writing publicly about each new thing I
begin will go a long way towards that (that's the hope at any rate).</p>
<h4>2. Remember what I read</h4>
<p>I suffer from a mild case of information addiction. Now I don't
feel the compulsive need to check social networks or email. I'm even
fairly sure that my Facebook login frequency is firmly in the
offend-my-friends zone. My information drug of choice happens to be
rss feeds (Quora comes a close second), and I've found that I can spend
the entire day skipping from one fascinating article to the next.</p>
<p>This wouldn't be so bad if I didn't have an entirely lousy memory.
Currently, I forget a lot of what I come across and am little better
off than not having read it at all. I might even be worse off for any
induced
<a href="http://psychcentral.com/blog/archives/2013/01/21/overcoming-information-overload/">cognitive overload</a>.</p>
<p>I've decided that the best way to make this work for me is to attempt
writing about (even a fraction of) the things I read. Writing is a
useful device to improve both retention and recall, and although
typing isn't quite as effective as putting
<a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704631504575531932754922518.html">pen to paper</a>,
its sure to help me remember more of what I read. More importantly,
forcing my ideas onto (virtual) paper will afford me the opportunity
to recognize connections between seemingly disparate ideas and place
them into a larger, richer perspective of the world.</p>
<h4>3. Improve as a person</h4>
<p>Finally, writing in of itself is a great habit to cultivate. Leo
Babuta has a great <a href="http://zenhabits.net/write-daily/">article</a> that
explains the many good things that come from regular writing. The
reasons that really resonated with me were the ability to -</p>
<ol>
<li>Think from the perspective of people around you.</li>
<li>Improve the clarity and logical consistency of your thoughts and
   opinions.</li>
<li>Reflect on your life and choices</li>
</ol>
<p>Individually, each of these traits are immensely beneficial. Together,
they transform you into a better, wiser person. And who wouldn't want
that?</p>
<p>So...here I am!</p>
