    <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m a PhD candidate at the University of Texas at Dallas, working with
my advisor Dr. Kevin W. Hamlen in the field of computer security. My
research focuses mostly on malware obfuscation, malware detection and
automated program rewriting. Some of that research has been featured
in the Economist, New Scientist, Wired and NBC News. I&#8217;m also
interested in artificial intelligence, philosophy, neuroscience, and
procrastinating (usually by playing on the guitar).</p>

<p>A list of some projects I&#8217;ve been working on and their associated
publications are listed below. You can also find my (soon-to-be at
this point) <a href="/index.html">blog here</a>.</p>

<h3>Projects</h3>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Frankenstein</strong> is a system that stitches together malware from benign
binaries. Given a high-level description of what the malware should
do, Frankenstein looks for semantically useful sequences of code
(adding two values, moving a value from one location to another,
etc) in the programs on a host system and finds combinations of
these sequences that when executed, implement the malware
description. It synthesizes a new binary for every combination it
finds, creating malware mutants that are composed entirely of bytes
from benign programs-making them much harder to detect using
standard feature-based detectors.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Stir</strong> is an automated program rewriting tool that prevents
ROP-attacks by self-randomizing all basic blocks within the program
at run-time, on each invocation, without source code or debug
information. If you don&#8217;t know where the gadgets are, you can&#8217;t use
them.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Reins</strong> is also an automated rewriter that requires no source code or
debug symbols, that can secure an untrusted program by enforcing
(custom) security policies. Want to make sure Outlook can&#8217;t attach
any files from your c:\SuperSecretWork\ directory? Reins can
rewrite it to do that. Or maybe you want to allow such an
attachment to be sent only once a day, and only if the recipient
happens to be you? Reins can do that too!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Macgyver</strong> is a mppalware propagation mechanism that works by
generating transformation functions that can take a benign file
(like Notepad) as input and produce the malware you want as
output. The transformation function consists of simple mathematical
operations and contains nothing that can be flagged as
malicious. Its a kind of encryption, except you transmit the
(harmless looking) encryption function, and the key happens to be a
benign file on the target system.</p></li>
</ol>


<p><em>Note: Unfortunately many (read all) of these projects are either
on-going efforts, or are being expanded into better (meaner?) versions
of themselves. As a result I don&#8217;t have any source code, or binaries
(but really you shouldn&#8217;t be downloading any binaries from me :) ) to
share at the moment. This may change in the not-too-distant future
though.</em></p>
