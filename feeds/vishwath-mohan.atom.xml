not be a reflection of my IRL productivity over that same time frame),
and the slowly rising level of shame proved to be just enough to
counter the unstoppable juggernaut that is my laziness. I now know how
much my laziness is worth - about 16 months of languishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, it would offend my deeply rooted laziness if I refused to
prevaricate in the 'passive-aggresive-productive-but-not-really' way I
do best and spend hours researching worthy blog framework contenders
first. So that's just what I did. It wasn't all fruitless though, oh
no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, I like Ruby, but I absolutely adore Python. The
&lt;a href="my-blog-setup.html"&gt;last time&lt;/a&gt; I was on the hunt for a suitable
framework, Jekyll and Octopress seemed better conceived aesthetically
than their Python counterparts (because who am I to sit and muck about
with themes and the like, html/css is too much effort). However, this
time around I was &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; pleasantly surprised at the maturity of both
&lt;a href="http://getnikola.com/"&gt;Nikola&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href="http://blog.getpelican.com/"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To my inexperienced eyes, they were both close enough in terms of
simplicity, features, community, and documentation that I ended up
making a decision based on...well nothing really, call it a coin-flip
that went in Pelican's favor. So far, it's been rather trivial to get
Pelican up and working, and cook up a quick script to migrate my posts
(&lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; 3 of them) over. I'm using the very awesome
&lt;a href="https://github.com/hdra/pelican-cait"&gt;pelican-cait&lt;/a&gt; theme, which I've
minimally modified for my needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike last time, I also have a vague, amorphous plan in terms of
subsequent posts, so this shouldn't turn into a graveyard like my
previous attempt. Only time will tell though...&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="blog"></category><category term="pelican"></category><category term="setup"></category></entry><entry><title>Configuring XMonad on Ubuntu 13.04</title><link href="/xmonad-on-ubuntu.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-05-02T21:01:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Vishwath Mohan</name></author><id>tag:,2013-05-02:xmonad-on-ubuntu.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I first tried &lt;a href="http://xmonad.org/"&gt;XMonad&lt;/a&gt; about a year ago, and its
since become an indispensable part of my standard Linux setup. It's an
incredible productivity booster, especially on dual monitor setups,
making it infinitely easier to rapidly switch between multiple
windows. It makes me weep a little inside each time I have to boot
back into Windows' single, non-tiling, keybinding devoid workspace (on
a side note, I've used both
&lt;a href="http://www.displayfusion.com/"&gt;DisplayFusion&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href="http://www.realtimesoft.com/ultramon/"&gt;UltraMon&lt;/a&gt; with some success
for a more keyboard focused experience, so it isn't all
bad. Still...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I either lie in the segment of Ubuntu users for whom XMonad does
not work out of the box, or the segment of Ubuntu users for whom
XMonad does not work out of the box &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; who need to head to the
interwebs to figure it out. Since I also end up (re-)installing Linux
on VM's, or my laptop, or the lab computer once every 4-5 months, and
forgetting the solutions I'd arrived at previously with astonishing
punctuality, this is a less than ideal scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in the interest of documenting this for my future self (and anyone
else who might find this useful) here are the steps to get XMonad to
work on your latest Ubuntu install -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Install gnome-panel&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;sudo apt-get install gnome-panel
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h4&gt;2. Install XMonad&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;sudo apt-get install xmonad
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h4&gt;3. Create your xmonad.hs&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one tripped me up for a while, but I realized I suffer from
   &lt;a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xmonad/+bug/1059358"&gt;this bug&lt;/a&gt;
   every time. I haven't figured out why, but the fix is pretty
   simple. Just, create a (possibly empty) xmonad.hs like so -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;mkdir ~/.xmonad
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;touch ~/.xmonad/xmonad.hs
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h4&gt;4. Replace your default mod key&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like replacing the mod key from its default of &lt;em&gt;Alt&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;Super&lt;/em&gt;
   (the Windows key). If that makes sense to you, you might want to
   edit your xmonad.hs with the minimal -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="kr"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;XMonad&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kr"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;XMonad.Config.Gnome&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nf"&gt;main&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;xmonad&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;gnomeConfig&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;modMask&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;mod4Mask&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h4&gt;5. Reload your xsession&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Log out of your current session and log back in using the 'Gnome
   with XMonad' option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there you go. Five incredibly simple steps to a vastly improved
dual monitor experience. Happy hacking!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="xmonad"></category><category term="ubuntu"></category><category term="raring ringtail"></category><category term="setup"></category></entry><entry><title>My Blog Setup</title><link href="/my-blog-setup.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-04-30T23:36:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Vishwath Mohan</name></author><id>tag:,2013-04-30:my-blog-setup.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm obsessive to a fault when it comes to researching the right tool
for a job. I could (and do) spend days sifting through article
after article comparing different languages, libraries, programming
paradigms, every little thing you could imagine every time I start a
new project. It's actually one of the reasons I have so many
incomplete projects on my hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Search&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally, picking a blog engine to use was no exception. I used a
small checklist of features for comparison as I looked around. Here
they are in no particular order -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a programmer I was looking for something that didn't deviate too
  far from a coding workflow (which is a fancy way of saying "me want
  emacs").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a security researcher I obviously prefered a solution that was as
  secure as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a lazy person, I wanted something that would be both functional
  and aesthetically sensible out of the box (or with minimal setup).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't need an overwhelming set of features, so simplicity (both
  of use and design) was preferable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to be able to go under the hood to make my own
  customizations if I wanted to. But more than that, I wanted to be
  able to look at the source and really understand what was going
  on. This is obviously harder that larger the code base gets, and so
  is somewhat related to the previous point. It's also related to the
  next two points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it catered to my irrational dislike and ignorance of PHP, then
  all the better (I really need to sit down and go beyond the hello
  world stuff with PHP at some point. Hopefully that point is very,
  very far away).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it catered to my irrational (it's not irrational really, I only
  say this out of a sense of fairness to the point above) love and
  appreciation of Python, Ruby, or Lisp then all the better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Warning: The rest of this post is outdated. I now use the most
 excellent &lt;a href="http://getpelican.com"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt; instead, which hits all
 the plus point above, and is additionally in Python. You can read
 about that &lt;a href="and-back.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Octopress is awesome&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I picked &lt;a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll"&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; initially, which
is more blog generator than blog engine. It takes a configuration
file, your posts and pages written in markdown and uses them to
generate (people also call it baking) an almost entirely static blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually though, I settled with
&lt;a href="http://octopress.org/"&gt;Octopress&lt;/a&gt;---an extra layer over Jeyll that
manages to add just enough to hit that sweet spot between features and
ease of use. It integrates easily with Twitter, Google Analytics and
other useful services, it also integrates with comment systems like
Disqus (which to be fair, Jekyll does too), and has options to easily
deploy to &lt;a href="http://pages.github.com/"&gt;Github Pages&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="https://www.heroku.com/"&gt;Heroku&lt;/a&gt; or any rsync enabled hosting
service. I really like how well Octopress manages to cover every
single point in my checklist -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Octopress allows me to write my posts locally using my editor of
   choice (*&lt;em&gt;cough&lt;/em&gt;*Emacs*&lt;em&gt;cough&lt;/em&gt;*), and makes it trivial to save,
   generate and deploy the generated site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jekyll (and consequently Octopress) uses git to manage both the
   markdown source and the generated site, making it easy to work
   across mulitple machines and still keep things synchronized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can't get more secure than an entirely (almost) static
   site. Well, technically you could not have a site at all and be
   more secure. But practically, a baked blog is about as exploit free
   as you could get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming you have Git and Ruby installed on your machine already,
   you can have a blog up and running in literally a few minutes. The
   Octopress site does a great job of explaining how to &lt;a href="http://octopress.org/docs/setup/"&gt;install and
   configure&lt;/a&gt; it to your liking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I switched my theme to
   &lt;a href="http://panks.me/blog/2013/01/new-octopress-theme-fabric/"&gt;Fabric&lt;/a&gt;---which
   I'm using as is simply because of how much I love it---but it
   wasn't because of any shortcomings with the default theme, which
   looks just great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The source for both Jekyll and Octopress is simple, well-written,
   and easy to read. It certainly doesn't hurt that they're both
   implemented in Ruby.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm currently hosting the blog on Github Pages, which seemed like a
good starting point. I don't have comments enabled at the moment,
which might seem like a controversial choice. I happened to read through
&lt;a href="http://mattgemmell.com/"&gt;Matt Gemmel's&lt;/a&gt; excellent chronicling of his
decision to disable comments recently, (you can read his first post on it
&lt;a href="http://mattgemmell.com/2011/11/29/comments-off/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and the
bottom of that page contains links to his follow-ups) and agree more
or less with what he has to say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it stands I don't really expect a vast readership, but if you have
something to say about anything I post, I'd be glad for you to give me
a shout out on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/vishwath"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; or by
&lt;a href="mailto:vishwath.mohan@gmail.com"&gt;mail&lt;/a&gt;, both of which seem like more
natural mediums to carry out a discussion.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Here I am</title><link href="/so-here-i-am.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-04-30T21:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Vishwath Mohan</name></author><id>tag:,2013-04-30:so-here-i-am.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've been meaning to blog for some time now, having a vague sense that
it would be beneficial but never really sitting down to examine it
more closely. I did just that today though, and realized that there
are so many good reasons for me to maintain one there was no point in
delaying it any longer. It seemed natural to begin by listing the top
3 things I'm expecting blogging will help me with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Complete what I begin&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often, when I'm working on a new project, I'm sorely tempted to go
online in an attempt to better educate myself about what's already
been done. A few hours and many links later, I've found something else
that interests me so much that I drop what I was working on to attempt
that instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some ways its a consequence of an entirely good thing---a sense of
fascination for the things I encounter. What I really need is
something to force my attention back to what I've started so I can see
them through to completion. Writing publicly about each new thing I
begin will go a long way towards that (that's the hope at any rate).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Remember what I read&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suffer from a mild case of information addiction. Now I don't
feel the compulsive need to check social networks or email. I'm even
fairly sure that my Facebook login frequency is firmly in the
offend-my-friends zone. My information drug of choice happens to be
rss feeds (Quora comes a close second), and I've found that I can spend
the entire day skipping from one fascinating article to the next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This wouldn't be so bad if I didn't have an entirely lousy memory.
Currently, I forget a lot of what I come across and am little better
off than not having read it at all. I might even be worse off for any
induced
&lt;a href="http://psychcentral.com/blog/archives/2013/01/21/overcoming-information-overload/"&gt;cognitive overload&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've decided that the best way to make this work for me is to attempt
writing about (even a fraction of) the things I read. Writing is a
useful device to improve both retention and recall, and although
typing isn't quite as effective as putting
&lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704631504575531932754922518.html"&gt;pen to paper&lt;/a&gt;,
its sure to help me remember more of what I read. More importantly,
forcing my ideas onto (virtual) paper will afford me the opportunity
to recognize connections between seemingly disparate ideas and place
them into a larger, richer perspective of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. Improve as a person&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, writing in of itself is a great habit to cultivate. Leo
Babuta has a great &lt;a href="http://zenhabits.net/write-daily/"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; that
explains the many good things that come from regular writing. The
reasons that really resonated with me were the ability to -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Think from the perspective of people around you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improve the clarity and logical consistency of your thoughts and
   opinions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect on your life and choices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individually, each of these traits are immensely beneficial. Together,
they transform you into a better, wiser person. And who wouldn't want
that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So...here I am!&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry></feed>
